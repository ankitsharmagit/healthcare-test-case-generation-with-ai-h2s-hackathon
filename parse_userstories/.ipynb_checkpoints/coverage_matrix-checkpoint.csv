An important assistive activity the system provides is to digitize what are currently physical artifacts such as patient assessments, care plans, and patient sign in/outs. As an improvement to the current physical workflow, the system will automate tracking of individuals through the program. In addition, the system will assist the staff in clerical duties such as billing, report generation, overseeing compliance with patients care plans, and providing tools to assist in the case of an audit. The system will accomplish these goals through the implementation of a desktop interface, database, and mobile application. The Clinician Portal will assist the Day Health staff in the creation and retrieval of their electronic medical records, billing, and report generation. The database will persistently track the status of the individuals enrolled in their program, and the mobile application will assist patients with signing in and out.",General,1,✅ Covered

The scope primarily consists of three parts, the database, the clinician portal, and the session application. The three of those parts each have a distinct scope. The database must be able to track all of the data that Trillium is looking to store. A huge part of this involves scanning and storing documents on a per patient basis. Each document may have different pieces of data that need to be tracked in the database. The database will be in charge of keeping track of what pieces of data each document is associated with as well as storing each instance of that data that has been input. The database will also store session data from each of Trillium’s patient sessions. This includes everything from departure and arrival times, session notes, and individual session notes. More specifics on data to be stored can be found in the product features section. The clinician portal is the primary user interface for our system. This will be a web application accessible from any compatible web browser. The clinician portal has 3 major parts: patients, sessions, and statistics/billing. The patients section will be where the user can add, modify, or check any patient data stored in the system. This includes basic functionality such as adding a new patient, adding a new scanned document to a patient, or checking on a patient’s basic info. The session section is where a user can go to add, modify, or check on any session data. This includes functionality such as scheduling a new session, modifying a session leader, or checking which classes are scheduled on a specific day. The third basic part is statistics/billing. The statistics/billing section will be where the user can find tools that are able to run tracking associated with patient data and billing. This may involve a tool that can get the patients that are billable for the week or similar tools. The session application is used by session leaders to standardize attendance tracking and session note­keeping. The session application will primarily be used to keep track of patients signing in to sessions. The session application will interface with a fingerprint scanner that the user will need to use to sign into a session. This gives Trillium a unique and precise timestamp for each individual that will allow them to determine how long a patient has been at each session.",General,1,✅ Covered
