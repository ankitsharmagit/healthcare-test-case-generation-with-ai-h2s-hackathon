Purpose\n\nThe Trillium Health Day Health Manager is a system primarily used to assist Day Health\n\nstaff in the tracking and care of patients in their Day Health program by multiple means. An important assistive activity the system provides is to digitize what are currently physical artifacts such as patient assessments, care plans, and patient sign in/outs. As an improvement to the current physical workflow, the system will automate tracking of individuals through the program. In addition, the system will assist the staff in clerical duties such as billing, report generation, overseeing compliance with patients care plans, and providing tools to assist in the case of an audit.\n\nThe system will accomplish these goals through the implementation of a desktop interface, database, and mobile application. The Clinician Portal will assist the Day Health staff in the creation and retrieval of their electronic medical records, billing, and report generation. The database will persistently track the status of the individuals enrolled in their program, and the mobile application will assist patients with signing in and out.\n\n1.2. Document Conventions\n\nThis document has been broken into three parts under most sections to cover the three\n\nfundamental parts of the application, the database, the Clinician Portal, and the session application. This document is modeled after the SRS template from the Software Requirements and Architecture class [A:1]. Throughout the document we reference different appendices, these references will be noted with the following convention: [Appendix Letter:Item Number]. For example the notation for referencing item one in appendix A (The SRS Template) would be [A:1].\n\n1.3.\n\nIntended Audience and Reading Suggestion\n\nThe intended audience of this document is all major stakeholders which include the\n\ndevelopment team, the project owner, the project customer, the senior project advisor (Professor Hawker), and anyone evaluating the project. It is recommended that you check out our team’s website and the documents hosted there for better background on the project, process, and the team.\n\n1.4. Project Scope\n\nThe scope for this project includes everything Trillium needs to replace their current\n\nsystem with our system in addition to a couple of extra features. The scope primarily consists of three parts, the database, the clinician portal, and the session application. The three of those parts each have a distinct scope.\n\nThe database must be able to track all of the data that Trillium is looking to store. A huge\n\npart of this involves scanning and storing documents on a per patient basis. Each document may have different pieces of data that need to be tracked in the database. The database will be in charge of keeping track of what pieces of data each document is associated with as well as storing each instance of that data that has been input. The database will also store session data from each of Trillium’s patient sessions. This includes everything from departure and arrival times, session notes, and individual session notes. More specifics on data to be stored can be found in the product features section.\n\nThe clinician portal is the primary user interface for our system. This will be a web application accessible from any compatible web browser. The clinician portal has 3 major parts: patients, sessions, and statistics/billing. The patients section will be where the user can add, modify, or check any patient data stored in the system. This includes basic functionality such as adding a new patient, adding a new scanned document to a patient, or checking on a patient’s basic info. The session section is where a user can go to add, modify, or check on any session data. This includes functionality such as scheduling a new session, modifying a session leader, or checking which classes are scheduled on a specific day. The third basic part is statistics/billing. The statistics/billing section will be where the user can find tools that are able to run tracking associated with patient data and billing. This may involve a tool that can get the patients that are billable for the week or similar tools.\n\nThe session application is used by session leaders to standardize attendance tracking\n\nand session note­keeping. The session application will primarily be used to keep track of patients signing in to sessions. The session application will interface with a fingerprint scanner that the user will need to use to sign into a session. This gives Trillium a unique and precise timestamp for each individual that will allow them to determine how long a patient has been at each session.\n\n1.5.

Database\n\nCurrently Trillium health uses largely paper forms and sharepoint to manage their patients care. This has been a less than an ideal solution, but no good medical software systems exist for group settings. The database’s role will be to host relevant documents and relate patient and clinical information in a meaningful way.\n2.1.2. Application\n\nA clinician portal is required to present and organize the contents of the database. This\n\nis the user­facing aspect of the system and will be implemented with special consideration given to usability. A successful implementation of this user interface will above all provide faster access to, and better presentation of, the clinic’s data.\n2.1.3. Session App\n\nAnother application is necessary to allow patients to easily check in to Day Health and\n\ninto specific sessions. This will allow the patients to verify their attendance using their fingerprints.\n\n2.2. Product Features\n\nInstall\n\n2.3.\n2.3.1.1.\n2.3.1.2.\n2.3.1.3.\n2.3.2.

Operating Environment\n\n2.5.1. Database\n\nThe database will exist on a Microsoft Windows Server That runs MSSQL 2008. This\n\nserver will only serve requests from inside trillium.\n2.5.2. Application\n\nThe main user application will be built as a web­based system. Users will access it\n\nthrough a browser and login window. The spring MVC model will be used as a base.\n2.5.3. Session App\n\nThe session application will be hosted on laptops with Windows OS.\n\n.\n\n2.6. Design and Implementation Constraints\n\n2.6.1. Database\n\nDatabase needs to be available to internal sources for queries. The customer would like\n\nthe database to be able to be easily modified in the future for other teams to upgrade the system or do work on it.\n2.6.2. Application\n\nFeatures need to be supportable in a web­application, security features and security\n\ndesign must address this reliance on the web. Additionally, both the design and the implementation needs to be usable by all clinicians.\n2.6.3. Session App\n\n2.7. User Documentation\n\n2.7.1. Database\n\nUser documentation will consist of the Database Schema and how to guide for running\n\ndatabase setup script.\n2.7.2. Application\n\nThe application shall have tutorial documentation, for the purpose of educating new\n\nusers as well as acting as a reference. Clear procedures and proper protocol must be explained in detail, as often these tasks must respect both legal and business concerns. These procedures shall be presented in step­by­step instructions which are accompanied by both screenshots and in­application tooltips. The goal here is to produce an interface which can self­teach its own practice to any first time users.\n2.7.3. Session App\n\nUser documentation will be limited on the session application as this is intended to be an\n\ninternal attendance verification/recording and note taking application. Navigation will be clearly marked and tool tips will be used to guide new facilitators.\n\n2.8. Assumptions and Dependencies\n\n2.8.1. Database\n\nUse of MS­SQL depends upon a Microsoft Windows operating system.\n\n2.8.2. Application\n\nDependent on Trillium’s Local Area Network. Will also depend upon the functioning of\n\nthe “Spring” model, upon which the Clinician Portal is being built(the customer already has experience working with “Spring”). Assume user’s are capable of using internet browsers. Assume that Day­Health continues to track patients and sessions in much the same way they do now.\n2.8.3. Session App\n\nFingerprint scanner is being built using customizations to the Person ID software offered\n\nby 360 Biometrics. We are working through their representative Pinky Thakkar to ensure that our software and database integrates smoothly with Person ID. We are assuming that by working closely with their development team we will be able to lower the chance of having large integration issues.\n\n3.
